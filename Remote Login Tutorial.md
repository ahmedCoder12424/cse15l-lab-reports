# Remote Login Instructions 

1. __Find CSE15l account__

Go to this [link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) and look up your account entering your username and PID.

2. __Change Password__

After finding your cse15l account click on it to change the password. When it asks for your username and PID again, __ENTER YOUR CSE15L USERNAME NOT YOUR GENERAL USERNAME__.
After doing so, change your password. __Make sure to select NO__ for changing general Triton link account's password.
